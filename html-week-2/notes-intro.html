        (The "head" is where you put page information and meta-data. This is also where external style sheets and Javascript files will be stored.)

        <p>The "title" tag define's the page's title. Hence, the element above appears on the browser bar and tab.</p>

    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Module 1.</h1> 

        <p>Now this is the body of the page. This is a paragraph. The &lt;strong&gt; tags are used to <strong>bold</strong> text. 
        While the &lt;em&gt; tags are used to <em>italicize.</em></p>

        <a id="headers"></a>
            <p>Here's another paragraph. Let's learn about headers.</p>
            <h1>&lt;h1&gt; is used for the header of the main section. Like the title of the page.</h1>
            <h2>&lt;h2&gt; is used for subsections. You cannot have a lone h2 element without an h1 element.</h2>
            <h3>&lt;h3&gt; is used for sub-subsections. Or just the subsection to h2. You get the concept.</h3>
            <h4>This is how &lt;h4&gt; looks like. DO NOT use the header elements without considering semantics. There is purpose.</h4>
            <h5>For example, this h5 is a subsection to the h4 above. Do not use header elements to change the font.</h5>
            <h6>You use CSS for that. And yes, this is &lt;h6&gt;.</h6>
        

        <h2><a id="anchors">Anchors</a></h2>
            <p>Let's talk about anchors. Or the &lt;a&gt; element.</p>
            &lt;a href="<em><strong>page location</strong></em>"&gt;<em>link text</em>&lt/a&gt; adds a link/hyperlink.

            <p>The href value is the path for the link. 
            <br>This can be an absolute path like "http://www.google.ca". Or a relative (to the page) path.
            <br>You can also point to an anchor with "#id" to link to an ID named "id". This like will jump to an element or anchor with this name.
            If the anchor or element is in another page. put the page location first followed by the # and the ID name. 
            <br>The anchor should be marked at the beginning of the content it is referring to. 
            <br>Like this:
            <br>&lt;a id="<em>element</em>"&gt;>&lt;/a&gt;

            <p>Let's try it. I am now going to insert tag to the section where I started talking about headers.</p>
            <br>Click <a href="#headers"> here</a> to see if it works and goes to the header section. Did it work?

        <h2><a id="images"></a>Images</h2>
            <p>Let's talk about the &lt;img&gt; element. Here's the correct syntax:</p>
            <p>&lt;img src="<em>linktothephoto.jpg</em>" alt="here's a photo"&gt;. A closing tag is not necessary.</p>

        <h2>Other elements</h2>
            <h3>Line break - br</h3>
                <p>Now let's discuss other elements. For example, the &lt;br&gt; element that represents a line break.</p>
                I've been using it all along. 
                <br>See? 
            <br>DO NOT use br where you would otherwise use a p. This is more for stylistic purposes and avoid using it in MOST cases.

            <h3>Unordered list - ul</h3>
                <p>The list items need to be enclosed with an &lt;li&gt; tag. For example:</p>
                <p>Things I need to do today:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Go through module 1 of web design class</li>
                    <li>Go through module 2 of Javascript class</li>
                    <li>Finish JS Lab 1</li>
                    <li>Do C# Assignment 0</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Ordered lists - ol</h3>
                <p>This refers to numbered lists. We can use the &lt;li&gt; tag with attributes like type="a", type="A", type="i", type="I", type="1" (the default one)</p>
                <p>You can also use the &lt;start&gt; attribute to declare a starting number other than 1. Use numbers on the attribute. For example:
                <p>This list starts with ii:</p>
                <ol type="i" start="2">
                    <li>the next item will be a iii</li>
                    <li>then a iv</li>
                    <li>see?</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

            <h3>Special Characters</h3>
                    <ul> 
                        <li><strong>&lt; and &gt;</strong></li> 
                        <p>All this time I've been using the <strong>&amp;gt;</strong> sequence  to show the > (greater than) symbol, and the <strong>&amp;lt;</strong> sequence to show the < (lesser than) symbol. I had just learned to use <strong>&amp;amp;</strong> to have a sequence not automatically render, wdhile it still appears on the source code.
                        </p>

                        <li>Ampersand (&amp;)</li>
                        <p>Always use &amp;amp to denote the ampersand symbol &amp; - DO NOT just put the and sign. (Reduce errors and bugs for future you: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3493405/do-i-really-need-to-encode-as-amp">Source</a>.)</p>
                    
                        <li>Copyright symbol Â©</li>
                        <p>Type directly by holding alt + "0169" on the number pad. If not possible, use <strong>&amp;copy;</strong> or type out <strong>&amp;#169;</strong> or <strong>&amp;#x000A9;</strong>.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: be mindful of having too many escaped characters in your code. In excess, the code can very quickly become a nightmare to read.</p>
                    </ul>
