<!--HTML is about properly describing content. Be aware of semantics and hierarchy-->

<!--make sure you indent properly; otherwise, right click + format document-->

<head> <!--within HTML tag, Head and body elements are required; head before body-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!--required tag within head; utf-8 is the recommended character set; an empty box is a mismatch between character set and encoding-->

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <p>Here's another paragraph. This is <em>italicized</em>.</p> <!--<em> stands for emphasis; default styling is italicized. <strong> is to strongly emphasize; default syling is bolded. If you want both, you can nest them.-->
    
    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>You can use anchor tags &lt;a&gt; to create a link; it needs an href attribute. For example: <a href ="www.google.ca">Google</a>.</p>
    <p>You can also do relative links. It will look like this: <a href ="/relative.html>A relative path"></a>.</p>
    <p>You can also create an internal link to jump to any part of the same page. You can create IDs for each element. </p>
    <p>This is a link to the top: <a href="#top">TOP</a></p> <!--If you need a dummy link, just use the # symbol as an href-->
